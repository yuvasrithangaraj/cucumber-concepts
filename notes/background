BACKGROUND in cucumber
____________________________________

It is to represent a collective list of pre conditions for all the scenarios
It allows you to add some context(info) to the scenarios in the feature file
It can contain one or more Given steps

It performs much like Hooks (@Before)
(i.e) Runs before each Scenario
whereas Hooks both have @Before and @After

We can have multiple hooks (@Before, @After) for a scenario
but In case of Background,
We can have ONLY ONE set of Background steps per feature

What if I have both hooks and background?
-Hooks is the first priority then only background runs
